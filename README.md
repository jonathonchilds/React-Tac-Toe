# React-Tac-Toe

An unbeatable tic-tac-toe game!

Created using TypeScript, React, Vite bundler/tooling, Sass, CSS3, HTML.

The API was written in Ruby, Rails, and Sinatra, which I forked from a public, open-source repository and re-deployed using Fly.io. 
The author of the API released the API via Heroku, but it has been broken since Fall of 2022. (So I re-deployed it myself!)
